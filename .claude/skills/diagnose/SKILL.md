# Diagnose

A discipline for hard bugs and regressions. Skip phases only when explicitly justified. All questions and findings reported to the user must be in **Portuguese (pt-BR)**.

When exploring the codebase, use the project's domain glossary from `.claude/CONTEXT.md` to get a clear mental model of the relevant modules, and check `docs/architecture/` for decisions in the area you are touching.

**Re-validation loop**: after every hypothesis, fix, or change, re-run the reproduction and the regression checks before declaring the bug resolved.

## Phase 1 — Build a feedback loop

**This is the skill.** Everything else is mechanical. If you have a fast, deterministic, agent-runnable pass/fail signal for the bug, you will find the cause — bisection, hypothesis-testing, and instrumentation all just consume that signal. If you do not have one, no amount of staring at code will save you.

Spend disproportionate effort here. **Be aggressive. Be creative. Refuse to give up.**

### Ways to construct one — try them in roughly this order

1. **Failing test** at whatever seam reaches the bug — unit, integration, e2e.
2. **Curl / HTTP script** against a running dev server.
3. **CLI invocation** with a fixture input, diffing stdout against a known-good snapshot.
4. **Headless browser script** (Playwright / Puppeteer) — drives the UI, asserts on DOM/console/network.
5. **Replay a captured trace.** Save a real network request / payload / event log to disk; replay it through the code path in isolation.
6. **Throwaway harness.** Spin up a minimised version of the problem in a new project, then debug that.

Ask the user in Portuguese when you need more data:

```text
Preciso de um exemplo minimo que reproduza o erro. Voce consegue me fornecer:

1. O comando ou acao que dispara o problema.
2. A saida ou mensagem de erro exata.
3. O ambiente (local, CI, staging, producao).

➡️ Se nao tiver, vou tentar construir um caso de reproducao sozinho.
```

## Phase 2 — Minimise the problem

**This is the skill.** If you cannot reproduce the bug in isolation, you cannot fix it. If you cannot minimise the problem, you cannot reproduce it. If you cannot reproduce it, you cannot fix it.

### Ways to minimise — try them in roughly this order

1. **Remove code** until the bug disappears. Add it back in small chunks to find the culprit.
2. **Remove data** until the bug disappears. Add it back in small chunks to find the culprit.
3. **Remove configuration** until the bug disappears. Add it back in small chunks to find the culprit.
4. **Remove dependencies** until the bug disappears. Add them back in small chunks to find the culprit.
5. **Remove environment** until the bug disappears. Add it back in small chunks to find the culprit.

## Phase 3 — Hypothesise

**This is the skill.** If you cannot explain the bug, you cannot fix it.

### Ways to hypothesise — try them in roughly this order

1. **Check the obvious.** Is the bug in the code you are looking at? Is it in the code you are calling? Is it in the code calling you?
2. **Check the documentation.** Is the bug in the docs you are looking at? Is it in the docs you are calling?
3. **Check the logs.** Are the logs telling the truth? Are they masking the real error?
4. **Check the tests.** Is the bug in the tests you are running? Are they covering the real path?
5. **Check the codebase.** Are there other call sites with the same pattern?

Report the hypothesis to the user in Portuguese:

```text
Hipotese atual: [DESCRICAO_DA_HIPOTESE].

Vou validar com [ACAO_EXPERIMENTAL]. Se confirmar, o proximo passo e [PROXIMO_PASSO].

Concorda ou quer que eu teste outra hipotese primeiro?
```

## Phase 4 — Instrument

**This is the skill.** If you cannot see the bug, you cannot fix it.

### Ways to instrument — try them in roughly this order

1. **Add logs** around the suspect seam.
2. **Add metrics** to measure the suspect behaviour.
3. **Add traces** to follow the request path.
4. **Add assertions** to fail fast on invariants.
5. **Add tests** that reproduce the bug before the fix.

## Phase 5 — Fix

Do the smallest, safest change that removes the root cause. Avoid band-aids. If the fix touches many files, present the plan to the user in Portuguese before editing.

```text
Raiz do problema: [RAIZ].
Correcao proposta: [DESCRICAO_DA_CORRECAO].
Arquivos afetados: [LISTA].

Posso aplicar a correcao e depois rodar os testes?
```

## Phase 6 — Regression-test and re-validate

**This is the skill.** If you cannot verify the fix, you cannot call it done.

### Required checks

1. **Reproduction fails before the fix, passes after.**
2. **Add a regression test** for the fixed bug.
3. **Run the affected test layer** (unit, integration, E2E).
4. **Run a lightweight regression** on neighbouring flows.
5. **Remove or revert instrumentation** that is no longer needed.

Report the result in Portuguese:

```text
Correcao aplicada em [ARQUIVOS].

- Teste de reproducao: [PASS/FAIL]
- Testes de regressao: [PASS/FAIL]
- Testes afetados: [PASS/FAIL]

O bug esta resolvido. Quer que eu abra uma Issue para documentar a causa raiz com /create-issues?
```

## Re-Validation Loop

Diagnosis is iterative. After every change, re-run the reproduction. If the bug moves or changes, go back to Phase 3. Do not declare the bug fixed until the reproduction passes and the regression suite is green.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Fixing without a reproduction first | Build a reproduction before changing code. |
| Skipping minimisation | Minimise first, or you fix symptoms, not the cause. |
| Removing instrumentation too early | Keep it until the fix is verified. |
| Not adding a regression test | Every fixed bug deserves a test. |
| Declaring done without re-validation | Re-run the reproduction and the suite. |
